# Fibonacci Sequence

## Problem Statement
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The first few numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc. The task is to implement a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number, given a positive integer "n". The program should be able to handle large values of "n" and calculate the Fibonacci number efficiently.

## Solving Approaches
There are several approaches to solving the Fibonacci sequence problem. Below, we discuss two of the most common methods:

### Brute Force Approach
The brute force approach involves recursively calculating each Fibonacci number starting from the first two numbers (0 and 1) and adding the previous two numbers in the sequence. While this method is straightforward, it is not efficient and may lead to long calculation times for larger values of "n".

### Recursive Approach
The recursive approach involves defining a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number by recursively calling itself with the previous two numbers in the sequence. This approach is simple to understand, but can be inefficient for larger values of "n" as it can lead to a large number of redundant calculations.

### Dynamic Programming Approach
The dynamic programming approach involves storing the previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in an array and using them to calculate the next number in the sequence. This method is much more efficient than the brute force approach and is suitable for large values of "n". The algorithm uses a bottom-up approach, starting from the base cases (the first two numbers in the sequence) and working up to the nth number.

### Recursive with Memoization
The recursive with memoization approach combines the recursive approach with memoization to store the solutions to subproblems in a cache and reuse them, avoiding redundant calculations. This approach strikes a balance between efficiency and simplicity, making it a popular choice for solving the Fibonacci sequence problem.
## Conclusion
The Fibonacci sequence is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, and there are several approaches to solving it. While the brute force approach is simple, it is not efficient for larger values of "n". The dynamic programming approach, on the other hand, is much more efficient and is the preferred method for solving the Fibonacci sequence problem.
