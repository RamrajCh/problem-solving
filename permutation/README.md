# Generate All Permutations of a List
## Problem Statement
Given a list of items, write a Python program to generate all permutations of the items in a specific order. A permutation is an arrangement of items in a specific order.

## Example
Consider the following example:

input: `[1, 2, 3]`

output: `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]`
