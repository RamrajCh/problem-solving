# Palindrome Detector

## Problem Statement
Given a string, the goal is to implement a program that can detect if the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

## Examples
- "A man a plan a canal Panama" is a palindrome
- "race a car" is not a palindrome
